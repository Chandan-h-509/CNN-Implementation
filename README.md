# CNN-Implementation
Implementation of CNN using PyTorch


In this project I have implemented CNN for Image Classification using PyTorch.
I have used the classic CIFAR10 dataset for this project.
The accuracy isn't that great because I have used plane CNN without any hyperparameter optimisation.
Further, I have implemented the same using RESNET for better accuracy. Link:
